## How Do We Know Anything

If you think about it, the inside of your own mind is the only thing you can be sure of. One could argue that there must be an external world, because things wouldn't be seen unless there were things out there that reflected or shed light into your eyes. Unfortunately, this is just a circular proof because it tries to prove the reliability of one's impressions by appealing to that impressions. What if all these things existed only in mind, like a giant dream or hallucination? If all your experience were a dream with nothing outside, then any evidence you tried to use to prove to yourself that there was an outside world would just be part of the dream. Therefore, if you want to find out whether what's inside your mind is any guide to what's outside your mind, you cannot depend on how things seem -- from inside your mind -- to give you the answer.

The most radical, perhaps loneliest, conclsion to draw from this would be that your mind is the only thing that exists, which is also known as **solipsism**. On the other hand, to conclude that you are the only thing that exists is more than the evidence warrants. We don't know anything beyond your impressions and experiences -- there is no way for us to tell -- this view is called **skepticism**. Regarding this view, there is a response: a dream, fro instance, has to be something from which you can wake up to discover that you have been asleep; a hallucination has to be something which others (or you later) can see is not really there. Impression and appearances that do not correspond to reality must be contraster with others that do correspond to reality, or else the contrast between appearance and reality is meaningless. The idea of a dream from which you can never wake up is not the idea of a dream at all: it is the idea of reality -- the real world in which you live, which is called **verificationism**.

If a belief in the world outside out minds comes so naturally to us, perhaps we don't need grounds for it. We can just let it be and hope that we're right. And that in fact is what most people do after giving up the attempt to prove it: even if they can't give reasons against skepticism, they can't live with it either. But this means that we hold on to most of out ordinary beliefs about the world in face of the fact that (a) they might be completely false, and (b) we have no basis for ruling out that possibility. Then, we are left with three questions:

1. Is it a meaningful possibility that the inside of your mind is the only thing that exists -- or that even if there is a world outside your mind, it is totally unlike what you believe it to be?
2. If these things are possible, do you have any way of proving to yourself that they are not actually true?
3. If you can't prove that anything exists outside your own mind, is it all right to go on believing in the external world anyway?

## Other Minds

To take a simple example, how do you know, when you and a friend are eating chocolate ice cream, whether it tastes the same to him as it tastes to you? You can try a taste of his ice cream, but if it tastes the same as yours, that only means it tastes the same to you: you haven't experienced the way it tastes to him. There seems to be no way to compare the two flavor experiences directly.
